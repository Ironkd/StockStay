## Final homepage copy (by section)

### Hero
- **H1:** Inventory & owner billing for short-term rental managers  
- **Lead:** Track supplies per property, automate owner reimbursement, and cut disputes. Less waste, less admin, more time for your portfolio.  
- **Primary CTA:** Book a demo  
- **Secondary CTA:** See how owner billing works  
- **Note (optional):** No credit card for demo. Free plan available.

### How it works (3 steps)
- **Section title:** How it works  
- **Subtitle:** Set up in minutes, scale across your portfolio  
- **Step 1 – Add properties & supplies:** Create a “property” (or unit) for each listing. Add consumables—toiletries, paper products, coffee pods, linens, cleaning supplies—with reorder points.  
- **Step 2 – Log usage at turnover:** Cleaners or ops log what was used or replaced per stay. Stock levels update by property so you always know what to restock.  
- **Step 3 – Bill owners with one click:** Generate itemized owner statements from actual usage. Export or send for reimbursement—no spreadsheets, no disputes.

### Built for turnover operations
- **Section title:** Built for turnover operations  
- **Subtitle:** Cleaners and ops teams log usage; you keep control  
- **Bullets:**  
  - Log consumables used per property at each turnover  
  - Low-stock alerts and reorder points so nothing runs out  
  - Shopping list built from low stock across all properties  
  - Move stock between storage and properties when needed  
  - Team permissions so cleaners see only the properties they service  

### Owner billing made easy
- **Section title:** Owner billing made easy  
- **Subtitle:** Transparent, itemized, dispute-proof  
- **Bullets:**  
  - Full audit trail: what was used, when, and at which property  
  - Itemized charges per property for reimbursements  
  - Export to PDF or CSV for owner statements and accounting  
  - Clear breakdowns so owners understand every line item  

### Works across multiple properties
- **Section title:** Works across multiple properties  
- **Subtitle:** One dashboard, many units  
- **Bullets:**  
  - Low-stock alerts per property so you restock the right unit  
  - Reorder points and par levels by supply and property  
  - See which properties use the most of what—optimize ordering  
  - Scale from a few units to hundreds without changing tools  

### Why not spreadsheets?
- **Section title:** Why not spreadsheets?  
- **Subtitle:** They don’t scale—and they cost you money  
- **Bullets:**  
  - Scaling pain: multiple tabs, copy-paste errors, no single source of truth  
  - Missed charges: easy to forget line items or properties when billing owners  
  - Disputes: “What was this charge?”—spreadsheets rarely have a clear audit trail  
  - Time: manual updates and reconciliation eat hours every month  

### STR use-case block (what you can track)
- **Section title:** Track what matters at turnover  
- **Subtitle:** Allocate and bill back by property  
- **Examples:**  
  - Toiletries (shampoo, soap, conditioner)  
  - Paper products (tissue, paper towels)  
  - Coffee pods & kitchen consumables  
  - Linens & towel replacement  
  - Cleaning supplies  
- **Closing line:** Every charge can be allocated per property and billed back to owners—with an audit trail that keeps everyone aligned.

### Who it’s for
- **Section title:** Who it’s for  
- **Subtitle:** Built for short-term and vacation rental operations  
- **For:**  
  - STR managers (5–500 units)  
  - Vacation rental companies  
  - Co-hosting teams and property managers  
- **Not for:** Retail warehouses or traditional inventory/SKU management.

### Pricing section
- Keep existing pricing cards; optional subtitle: “Simple pricing for property managers”  
- CTA on cards can stay “Get Started” / “Start Free Trial” or align with “Book a demo” if you prefer.

### Final CTA section
- **Title:** Ready to simplify supply tracking and owner billing?  
- **Subtitle:** Join short-term rental managers who track per property and bill with confidence.  
- **Button:** Book a demo  (or “Start your free trial”)
